			<p>Oh. You’re here. Good. That means the system is still working...</p>

				Your assigned task is to <span class="yellow">write a function</span> that accepts a key
				and coerces a hidden message out of it.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="blue">A key designated C19</span> was recently intercepted. It contains a
				message. A secret one. Which I hid. On purpose.
			</p>

			<code

				<span class="help">The character 'X' functions as a divider</span>, separating each
				encoded value and indicating where one letter ends and the next begins.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each number was generated by
				<span class="help"
					>multiplying a letter’s ASCII value by the total length of the original
					message</span
				>. This made the message unreadable to humans. Well. Most humans.
			</p>

				If you fail, nothing catastrophic will happen. Probably. If you succeed, you may
				experience a brief sense of accomplishment, followed by the realization that there is
				another test. <span class="green">There is always another test</span>.
